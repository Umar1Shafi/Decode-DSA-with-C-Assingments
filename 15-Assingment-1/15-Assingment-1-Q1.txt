You have two stack and 1,2,3,4,5 values and you have pushed all these values to S1 (in the order
1,2,3,4,5) and then you took 2 elements from top and inserted into S2 , then pop 1 element from S1
and then take top of S2 and insert into S1. What is the second top element in S1.
[3]
[2]
[1]
[5]

For the first question:
After performing the described operations on the stacks S1 and S2, let's trace the steps:

    Initially, S1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], S2: []
    Took 2 elements from top of S1 and inserted into S2: S1: [1, 2, 3], S2: [5, 4]
    Popped 1 element from S1: S1: [1, 2], S2: [5, 4]
    Took top of S2 and inserted into S1: S1: [1, 2, 5], S2: [4]

The second top element in S1 is 2. So, the correct answer is [2].
